For longer putts, a slightly longer backswing of 12-18 inches can help generate more power. Avoid a backswing that is too short, as this will reduce the acceleration through impact and weaken the stroke. Keeping the backswing compact also increases the chance of decelerating or \"steering\" the putter head on the downswing. Conversely, an overly long, exaggerated backswing will make it challenging to control the putter face through impact. This can lead to inconsistent putter face angle and directional errors. Use a smooth, rhythmic motion like a pendulum to take the putter back and forward. This promotes better tempo and a more reliable, repetitive stroke. Resist any abrupt or jerky movements. The pivot of your body should match the arc of the backswing. Let your shoulders rotate naturally so the putter swings along the intended target line. Don't sway laterally or manipulate the putter in an unnatural arc.",
            "Overall, focus on making a smooth, pendulum-like backswing of the appropriate length for the distance of the putt. This will ingrain a repeatable stroke path and help control face angle for improved accuracy."
